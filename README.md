Scripts to run linux commands in docker containers
Inspired by [docker compose scripts](https://github.com/docker/compose/tree/master/script) and [@jfrazelle dotfiles](https://github.com/jfrazelle/dotfiles)

# Requirements
Obviously docker engine needs to be installed before using these scripts

# Linux
For more simplicity in usage, place the dockerised-tools in your $PATH

# Windows
Intend to replace cygwin by some usefull docker containers.
Your docker-machine needs to be set up before using these tools.

## env in PowerShell
To register your docker-machine env, launch:
```PowerShell
 > Import-Module <PATH\TO\env.psm1>
 ```
