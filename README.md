Scripts to run commands in docker container

# requirements
Obviously docker needs to be installed before using these scripts

# linux
For more simplicity in usage, place the dockerised-tools in your $PATH

# Windows
Your docker-machine needs to be set up before running env.bat
In env.bat don't forget to replace your boot2docker VM name (default : dev)

# TODO
- [x] organise files in linux/windows folders
- create batch version for
 - [x] lynx
 - [x] nmap
